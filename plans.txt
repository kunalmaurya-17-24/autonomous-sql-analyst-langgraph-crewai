Great! The screenshot confirms that you have MySQL 8.0 and MySQL Workbench installed on your machine. You're almost there.

Since you don't know the password (because the code was from a repo), here is exactly how to find it or set it up:

1. Try a Default Password
Often, people set it to something simple like root, password, or admin123. You can try entering these in your 
.env
 as the DB_PASSWORD.

2. If you don't know the password (Safe Reset)
Since you already have MySQL Installer - Community (visible in your screenshot), you can reset the password easily:

Open MySQL Installer from your Start menu.
Click on the "Reconfigure" link next to "MySQL Server 8.0".
Click "Next" until you reach the "Accounts and Roles" page.
Enter a New Root Password (make it something simple like admin123).
Finish the wizard.
3. Update the System
Once you have your password:

Put it in the 
.env
 file under DB_PASSWORD.
Run the 
create_tables.ipynb
 notebook to actually "get" the data and tables into your MySQL.
Once those tables are created, your autonomous CrewAgent will finally be able to actually "talk" to the database!
